## Configuration (optional)

Default settings live in `config.js` (see `config.example.js`):
- PERPLEXITY_API_URL: https://api.perplexity.ai/chat/completions
- PERPLEXITY_MODEL: sonar
- CACHE_DURATION: 7 days
- MAX_RETRIES / RETRY_DELAY for API calls

You can prefill `PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` in `config.js` for team installs. If set, the setup screen is skipped.

## Privacy

- Your Perplexity API key is stored locally via Chrome storage
- Only the current page URL is sent to Perplexity for analysis
- Analysis results are cached locally; nothing is uploaded elsewhere

---

## Troubleshooting

- No results yet? Wait a few seconds‚Äîanalysis runs automatically.
- Badge missing? Some URLs (e.g., chrome://) are skipped; try another site.
- Invalid key? Keys must start with "pplx-". You can update it from the popup (‚öôÔ∏è).
- See errors: chrome://extensions/ ‚Üí PrivacyAI ‚Üí Inspect views: service worker (Console)
